Below are the instructions for the game:

When you start the program, you will be asked for a name. 
Then, the rules of blackjack will be displayed and you will
be asked for a bet amount. As you play, the cards you have
will update on the window as the program runs. Along with the
cards updating, your money will too.

Have Fun!
